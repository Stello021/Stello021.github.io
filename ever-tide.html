							<h1 style="text-align: center;">Ever Tide</h1>
							<p>Ever Tide is a turn-based JRPG set in a fantasy world, 
							where the player needs to collect different items and defeat creature to discover the mistery that hide this fallen world. </p>
							<h3>My Role</h3>
							<p>
								As Gameplay Programmer my role included working on the entire Combat System, UI programming, Save System and Enemy AI (pathfinding and combat).
							</p>
							<h4>Enemies in Overworld</h4>
							<p>
								In Overworld levels i implemented a simple patrolling system for enemies using Unreal built-in nav mesh and spline to trace path to following.
								Except bosses that cannot move in Overworld, there are 2 different patrolling types:
								<ul>
									<li>
										not respawnable enemies with prefixed spline path
									</li>
									<li>
										respawnable enemies with randomic spawn point and spline path from a pre-configured array 
									</li>
								</ul>			
							</p>
							<h4>Combat System</h4>
							<img src="images\(318) Ever Tide 00-02-18.png" align="center" width="50%" height="100%">
							<p>
								Combat System is based by a custom Game Mode that manage the course of the fight. <br>
								In BeginPlay, it take references for each unit in the battle. <br>
								During Tick, instead, the turn queue is determined, is managed start and end of it, and is managed lose or victory conditions. <br>
								Enemies attack is selected randomly from a pool of different commands depending on type.   
							</p>
							<h5>Player Actions</h5>
							<ul>
								<li>
									<strong>Attack</strong>: Simple attack based on Player's Attack stat and selected enemy's defense to calculate damage
								</li>
								<li>
									<strong>Skills</strong>: Each skill has a power used to calculate damage along with the above mentioned stats.<br>
									There are skill that modify self or enemies stats and healing stats (negative damage on itself) 
								</li>
								<li>
									<strong>Items</strong>: They acts as skills but with prefixed values.
								</li>
								<li>
									<strong>Run</strong>: Back to Overworld.
								</li>
							</ul>
							<h4>Save System</h4>
							<p>
							Data are stored using save slots and Game Instance is used to transport values through varous levels. <br>
							For saving defeated enemies and not respawn it in overworld, a randomic unique integer ID is used for every enemy asset in their Construction script.
