											<p>Ever Tide is a turn-based JRPG set in a fantasy world, 
											where the player needs to collect different items and defeat creature to discover the mistery that hide this fallen world.</p>
										</div>

										<div class="project-role">
											<h2>My Role</h2>
											<p>As Gameplay Programmer my role included working on the entire Combat System, UI programming, Save System and Enemy AI (pathfinding and combat).</p>
										</div>

										<div class="project-features">
											<h2>Enemies in Overworld</h2>
											<p>In Overworld levels i implemented a simple patrolling system for enemies using Unreal built-in nav mesh and spline to trace path to following.
											Except bosses that cannot move in Overworld, there are 2 different patrolling types:</p>
											<ul>
												<li>not respawnable enemies with prefixed spline path</li>
												<li>respawnable enemies with randomic spawn point and spline path from a pre-configured array</li>
											</ul>

											<h2>Combat System</h2>
											<div class="feature-image">
												<img src="images\(318) Ever Tide 00-02-18.png" alt="Combat System">
											</div>
											<p>Combat System is based by a custom Game Mode that manage the course of the fight.</p>
											<ul>
												<li>In BeginPlay, it take references for each unit in the battle.</li>
												<li>During Tick, instead, the turn queue is determined, is managed start and end of it, and is managed lose or victory conditions.</li>
												<li>Enemies attack is selected randomly from a pool of different commands depending on type.</li>
											</ul>

											<h3>Player Actions</h3>
											<ul>
												<li><strong>Attack</strong>: Simple attack based on Player's Attack stat and selected enemy's defense to calculate damage</li>
												<li><strong>Skills</strong>: Each skill has a power used to calculate damage along with the above mentioned stats. There are skill that modify self or enemies stats and healing stats (negative damage on itself)</li>
												<li><strong>Items</strong>: They acts as skills but with prefixed values.</li>
												<li><strong>Run</strong>: Back to Overworld.</li>
											</ul>

											<h2>Save System</h2>
											<p>Data are stored using save slots and Game Instance is used to transport values through varous levels.<br>
											For saving defeated enemies and not respawn it in overworld, a randomic unique integer ID is used for every enemy asset in their Construction script.</p>
